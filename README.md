About:
Have a Wonderful Day is an interactive story generator about a random Saturday morning set in the first person.  The story line has both positive and nagative outcomes that are randomly generated after the user clicks on option buttons during each scene.  The plotline starts with the player waking up in their apartment on a Saturday morning.  They quickly begin their day with a job in the park.  They encounter an animal and have the option to interact with the animal or keep jogging.  The user chooses an option and a random outcome is produced on the screen.  The user then procedes through three more interactive scenes including a perilous street crossing, an extordinarily long line in a cafe, a bizarre shopping trip and a potentially harrowing commute home.
The final scene summarizes the users morning after they return home safely to their apartment.
